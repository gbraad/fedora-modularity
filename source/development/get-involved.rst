   group <https://pagure.io/group/modularity>`__ requesting membership.

Get in touch
------------

There's no dedicated mailing list yet and everything regarding this
topic should be discussed on the general `Fedora Development
list <https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel.lists.fedoraproject.org/>`__.
Most of us also hang out on the #fedora-modularity channel on Freenode.

Planning
--------

Formal meetings are held once a week by the Modularity Working Group.
See the
`Fedocal <https://apps.fedoraproject.org/calendar/modularity/>`__ to
find out when the group is meeting.

Development Method
------------------

We will use `agile software
development <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development>`__
methods for Modularity, more specifically: a hybrid of
`Scrum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)>`__
and `Kanban <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)>`__
adapted to the constraints we have in Fedora. For instance, not all
contributors can commit to be involved like a regular, full-time
employee, meaning that rigid use of 2-week-long Scrum Sprints can be an
obstacle to participating for some people.

If you're not familiar with agile development or the methods we use,
here are some links to get you started:

-  `Learn Scrum in 8
   minutes <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QfFu-YQfK4>`__
-  `Kanban applied to
   Scrum <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EIMxyFw9T8>`__

Agile development methods often come with their own lingo that can be
confusing to the "uninitiated"—like
`"epic" <http://agiledictionary.com/epic/>`__,
`"sprint" <http://agiledictionary.com/iteration/>`__ (or
`"iteration" <http://agiledictionary.com/iteration/>`__),
`"spike" <http://agiledictionary.com/spike/>`__. Many of the terms used
are explained over at the `Agile
Dictionary <http://agiledictionary.com/>`__.

We manage the project using `Taiga <https://taiga.io/>`__ on Fedora
Infrastructure, `one
instance <http://taiga.fedorainfracloud.org/project/modularity/>`__ for
individual sprint work items and
`another <http://taiga.fedorainfracloud.org/project/modularity-roadmap/>`__
for higher-level stuff ("epics").

Technical details
-----------------

Code repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We currently host all of our code at `Pagure <https://pagure.io/>`__ —
the infrastructure, the client-side tooling, metadata specification
drafts and even a couple of proof-of-concept modules. Repositories
typically start with the *fm-* prefix and are open to all members of the
`Pagure @modularity group <https://pagure.io/group/modularity>`__.
