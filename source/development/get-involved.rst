Get in touch
------------

There's no dedicated mailing list yet and everything regarding this
topic should be discussed on the general `Fedora Development
list <https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/devel.lists.fedoraproject.org/>`__.
Most of us also hang out on the #fedora-modularity channel on Freenode.

Planning
--------

Formal meetings are held once a week by the Modularity Working Group.
See the
`Fedocal <https://apps.fedoraproject.org/calendar/modularity/>`__ to
find out when the group is meeting.
