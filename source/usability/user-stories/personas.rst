Personas
========

The information below relates to personas developed for the use of the
Modularity working group. These personas will be continually updated as
more information is gathered from existing users that fit these roles.
Also, any information provided by community members or working group
team members will be incorporated as well.

What is a Persona
-----------------

Personas are fictional characters created to represent the different
user types that might interact with a product in different ways. They
are not market segments but should be thought of as user archetypes.

Personas are useful in considering the goals, desires and limitations of
users in order to guide decisions about the product. They should be
based on user research and should by 1-2 page descriptions that include
behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes and environment details.

There should be a primary persona defined along with secondary personas.
More than one can be primary, but no more than 3 in order to keep the
team focused in their design and implementation work.

Benefits of Personas
--------------------

Common benefits include:

-  Help the team share a common understanding of their various users
   groups and audiences
-  Proposed designs can be guided by how well they meet the needs of
   certain personas
-  Features can be prioritized based on how well they address the needs
   of one or more personas
-  Provides a human “face” to the user that can help create empathy for
   the people represented

and project meetings where she helps to keep things on track and making
sure the business objectives are still going to be achieved.

In the afternoon, her goals are to write up proposal and plans. She also
prefers to spend at least one hour looking through the data to support

business.

Enterprise System Administrator - Yvonne
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Ensure current IT infrastructure works seamlessly*

**Quote**

“What people don’t realize is that being an System Administrator is a

well, she gets ready, takes care of her family and heads into the
office. Upon arriving at the office, she makes a pot of coffee and again
checks her email. Her priorities include correcting any issues that are
stopping others from working and escalating anything that she cannot
work on herself. Yvonne then checks in with her supervisor on the day's
activities, checks on any hardware deliveries and communicates with
co-workers on overall system status.

Enterprise System Architect - Kevin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Links the business mission, strategy and processes to the IT strategy*

**Quote**

“I love my job...I am one of a few who get to work strategically with
Leadership and still maintain a technological connection to the product.
Exploring new technologies and innovations and figuring out how our
product can benefit is one of my favorite aspects of the job. It can be
very stressful and demanding, but that is how I know I am making a
difference to my team, product and company.”

**Background**

-  B.S. in Computer Science
-  25 years experience
-  Expert skills in software design and testing; Agile
-  Knows Java, JavaScript, C, C++, HTML5 and CSS
-  Uses Eclipse IDE

**Primary Goals**

-  To set strategic goals through collaboration with senior leadership.
-  Ensure the overall integrity of the application.
-  Document and communicate industry trends and a roadmap for
   implementing.
-  High-level understanding of the entire system.
-  Responsible for selecting systems and specifying deployment
   lifecycles and system configuration.

**Pain Points**

-  Constantly need to sell ideas that may result in deadline changes.
-  Not enough resources to keep things as current as needed.
-  No authority to make things happen; always negotiating between
   timeline, budget and technology.
-  Spend a lot of time documenting requirements, needs and trends in
   order to communicate to all stakeholders.

**A Day in the Life**

Kevin starts his day by catching up on his feeds related to security,
serviceability and other industry trends to make sure he is aware of new
ideas. He then has his daily standups with the dev teams and meets one
on one with team members that have issues or that he needs to ask
questions of.

Kevin spends the majority of his afternoon documenting the roadmap and
evaluating options to determine if they meet feature requests/needs and
how they fit into his strategies to meet enterprise compliance. Once a
week, he meets with Senior Leadership to report on progress as well as
identify any recommended changes to direction that he has. If leadership
has issues with his recommendations, he needs to wrap back around and
come up with other alternatives or bolster his arguments for proceeding
with his original recommendation.

Enterprise Developer - Rajiv
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Design and implement code*

**Background**

-  BS in Computer Science
-  8 years of experience

   ability to deliver new functionality
-  Too much bureaucracy in the organization

**A Day in the Life**

When Rajiv gets to the office he spends a few minutes catching up on his
feeds and checking email. Then he participates in his team’s standup
meeting and sets up some time with a coworker who he needs help from to
complete his story. Until he can meet with him, Rajiv works on fixing
bugs that have been found. Late morning, Rajiv has two project meetings
to attend and then has his quick meeting to unblock his story.

After lunch, Rajiv finishes his story and starts on the next one in his
backlog. Usually there are additional bugs that get filed throughout the
afternoon so he reserves the last hour and half to work on those before
heading home.

Enterprise DevOps Developer - Devin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Continuous integration/Continuous delivery*

**Quote**

“Some folks think I’m a sys admin, others think I’m a coder. The truth
is, I’m both and a lot more!”

**Background**

-  B.S. in Computer Science
-  10 years experience
-  Skilled in IT operations and software testing
-  Specializes in Java as well as Python and Perl
-  Uses Jenkins and Ansible

**Primary Goals**

-  Ensuring that all applications migrate smoothly throughout the entire
   lifecycle, from the development process to production support.
-  Ensuring that the automation process works efficiently among the
   team: developers who implement features, system administrators who
   manage access control, and operators who monitor the applications and
   servers.
-  Identifying the root cause of problems in test, staging and
   production environments, as well as the infrastructure.

**Pain Points**

-  Multiple tools, integration points, incompatibilities, and problems
   with PaaS and IaaS create many obstacles.
-  When a build cannot pass the tests, a lot of time is spent looking
   for the team members who are responsible for the build or the
   specific feature that is causing a problem. This is exacerbated when
   he does not know the responsibilities of certain people on the team.

**A Day in the Life**

Devin starts his workday by checking on the status of the overnight
builds. One build failed miserably, so his first order of business is to
find out why. After he figures out which component appeared to cause the
problem, he opens a Severity 1 ticket on that component so the
responsible developer will be notified immediately. Devin gets an
automated out-of-office notification from that developer, so he has to
inspect and fix the code himself, and then kick-off the test of the
build again.

Because of the unexpected issue, Devin arrives late to the weekly DevOps
meeting with his team of developers, quality engineers, and product
managers. The main topic is the decreasing availability and performance
of the deployment system, so they need to plan for a more scalable and
performant solution. After this, he completes his daily status report
about the CI/CD pipeline to the engineering management team. Once that
is sent, Devin, intermittently coordinates work among his team members
in between the moments he gets to modify the scripts that orchestrate
the complete deployment of development, QA, and production environments.

Business Operations - Isaac
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Management of the Operations Team*

**Background**

-  B.S. in Information Systems
-  8 years experience - Cloud Services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
-  Specializes in Java, Python; knows C, C++
-  Expert knowledge of UNIX, LINUX and Windows

**Primary Goals**

-  Ensuring successful day-to-day operations of the technology
   infrastructure and that all Service Level Agreements (SLA) with
   customers are met, and creating plans and providing support for
   instances when an SLA is compromised.
-  Quickly receiving and reviewing real-time reports of critical SLA
   criteria: availability, system response times, security/privacy,
   disaster recovery time, call center resolution time, dispute
   mediation, and change management.
-  Scheduling, budgeting, and staffing system maintenance and upgrades
   to ensure maximum operational performance.

**Pain Points**

-  Technological and financial limitations make it very challenging to
   migrate legacy applications to the cloud

**A Day in the Life**

The first order of business for Isaac is to review the reports of system
operations from the previous day. He’s especially interested in the
availability numbers because a big software upgrade was applied to a few
servers overnight. Fortunately, system availability was not affected,
and the upgrade should improve the numbers for system response time, so
it was a win-win for customers and Isaac, who constantly keeps his eye
on the SLA commitments.

Afterwards, Isaac attends a meeting with his staff to discuss the exit
strategy plan for a customer who will be leaving their service at the
end of the month. A smooth transition is a must.

Isaac then has a series of meetings with the technical leads on his
staff to discuss proposals for rolling out new server hardware during
the next quarter. He needs to balance capacity and performance with the
tight budget he’s been given for expansion, so he needs lots of details
so he can evaluate and select from the multiple options on the table.

Product Manager - Pablo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Customer and industry liaison to the product and the company*

**Quote**

“A lot of my time is spent gathering resources, coordinating various
teams to agree on decisions or work to achieve customer goals. I need to
spend more time distilling down ideas and driving agreement across
disparate teams. My role is about working with other to build the grand
plan. Improving communication, clarity on commitment and direction,
would result in more timely decision making.”

**Background**

-  B.S. in Computer Science
-  5+ years experience, including project management + software
   development environment
-  Deliver multiple projects, cross-functionally
-  Expert planner with business process definition
-  Influencer in org up to SVP with more experience

**Primary Goals**

-  Understand product’s business + UX needs
-  Coordinate design, development, delivery, documentation, launch,
   sales enablement + requests, service, integration, support.
-  To work with stakeholders, UX + Dev to transform requirements into
   experiences to deliver + assure all are met.
-  Managing market requirements, trends, competitive landscapes,
   constraints, cost, models, time, scope, risks and P+L to the
   executive team.
-  Manage customer partnerships + grow business opportunities
-  Understanding company's strategic goals + reflecting those in the
   product

**Pain Points**

-  Stakeholder buy in
-  Delivering on time
-  Visibility into cross functional statuses
-  Having enough time to spend with all the team and juggling priorities
-  Driving problem resolution

**A Day in the Life**

Pablo begins his day by checking his calendar, sees what meetings he has
today. Next he reviews emails and follows up on any IMs that he may not
have responded to. If any fires have occurred overnight, Pablo will jump
on resolving issues or unblocking progress. He gets on a couple of
customer calls and works to either gain insights or resolve issues with
the customer. His day is full of meetings with co-workers, executives
and conversations with customers. He is always working to coordinate and
manage the products across teams and throughout the company, as well as
with the customer base. This also means that Pablo occasionally touches
base with some of the Sales and Customer Experience teams. He
occasionally goes on site to visit customers + partners. He typically
makes rounds with Development + Project Management to assure that
everything is on track. Pablo says that his role requires him to wear
many hats. He considers his role part visionary, traffic coordinator,
technologist and communicator. “I love my job, it energizes and exhausts
me, all at the same time! Have more data to provide insights and
guidance would give me more time to focus on gaining deeper insights
into customer + market needs, rather than focusing on if the work is
going to get done.”
